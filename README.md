<h1 align="center" style="font-size: 5em;" >Incident management project</h1>

# Introduction
This project was developed during my internship as a real-world solution for managing technical incidents in an organization. The system is designed to optimize how incidents are reported, tracked, and resolved â€” helping technical teams improve response time and efficiency.

# About the project
The Incident Management System is a full-stack web application built with React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL, using Vite for fast frontend development. It provides a centralized platform for administrators and technicians to manage technical incidents. Key features include user management, incident tracking, role-based access control, and PDF export of reports. The system is designed to be intuitive, secure, and scalable.

## Terminal commands

After poling the project in you local machine you should have a postgraSQL database with the port 8000, you can change the port from the "server/src/config/database.mjs" in this part:
```
4 const client = new Client({
5   host: 'localhost',
6   port: 8000,  // <-- change the port from 8000 to you port (default port is 5432)
7   user: 'postgres',
8   password: 'a2y0',
9   database: 'db_intervention_management'
10 });
```
After that, open two terminal, one for the frontend and the other for the backend, in the first terminal use these commands after being incide the project.
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
in the secound terminal run these commands.
```
cd server
npm install 
npm run dev
```
In the backend side make sure that you have these messages to make sure that evrything is runing correctly:

```

If you wanna connect as a technician, your account should be added from your administrator, so you don't have so sign up because of your role, there is a data to connect with if you wanna test your app:
```
aymen@gmail.com
test1234  <-- you can't see the password from the database because it's hashed

The technician has the same pages , the only thing that changed is that he can't add a new ticket and he can change the status, and add a comment about the ticket.
